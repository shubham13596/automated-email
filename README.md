JS code to automate emails over my gmail at pre-defined times

This was an attempt to use Google Apps Script to automate sending emails. 
My first attempt was maintaining a repository of all of my favoruite quotes and send me one each day at a pre-determined time.
My second attempt was similar in terms of sending me the links to NYT archived articles which I had maintained in a Google sheet.
